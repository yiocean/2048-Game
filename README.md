# Reinforcement Learning of 2048 Game

This project is currently in progress.

### Train
The files in this folder are primarily used for model training. We implement and apply the N-tuple network and Temporal Difference learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, TD(0) learning, and TD-afterstate learning, to optimize the AI's performance in the game. To get started, download the three files in this folder and run `python playByTuple.py`.

### Human
This folder contains the 2048 game environment that I've developed. It allows human players to interact with and play the game, offering an intuitive interface for gameplay. To play 2048 on your terminal, download the three files from this folder and execute `playByHuman.py`.

### Tuple
This folder is for testing the tuple-based evaluation method specifically in the context of the 2048 game, without involving the TD learning component.
